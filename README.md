# LogicBomb
These are basic Pyinstaller Binaries which can be used as a LogicBomb(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_bomb) in any code(Or Software).
When these Binaries are executed, New Browser tabs are opened a random number of time(1000 Here) which disrupts the user's workflow and hence are LogicBombs.
